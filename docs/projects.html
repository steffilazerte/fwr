<strong>Scope:</strong> A lake shore capacity model such as that developed by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment (MOE) or the District of Muskoka will be employed to determine the sources of phosphorus entering the lakes (external phosphorus load). Such a model can also estimate pre-development water quality and determine, whether any further development around the lake would noticeably reduce its present water quality. Internal phosphorus load will be incorporated in shallow mesotrophic Bright Lake as described in Nürnberg &amp; LaZerte 2004 and results of such a model will be compared to those of a more simply estimated internal load by the typical MOE capacity model equations. In addition to the phosphorus mass balance, late-summer volumetric dissolved oxygen concentration will be assessed in deep oligotrophic Basswood Lake to determine its manageability for Lake Trout, according to the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources guidelines.</p>
